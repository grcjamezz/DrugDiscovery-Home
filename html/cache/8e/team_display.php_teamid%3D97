rhetoric to explore the facts. 
<br><br>
 There are teams that recruit members based on philosophy, others that 
recruit based upon what Distributed Computing projects they prefer. We 
are neither of these and no demands are made of new members. We do 
encourage all who would join to consider our community a class room
 fully 
expecting to learn and have every opportunity to contribute for we 
believe you have something special to offer. Every Team Member has a
 voice 
and each individual's voice is heard and given equal weight. 
<br><br>
<big><b><u>Calm Chaos is an International Team.</u></b></big> Out of 
diversity comes knowledge and understanding.
<br><br>
 At Calm Chaos, everyone is welcome to join us in our forum 
conversations, chats, and semi-heated debates. Regardless of whether or
 not you 
join the Calm Chaos team, our forums are open to all. We are a laid
 back, 
easy going group that allows people to be just who they are, 
individuals; individuals whom may be philosophical, funny, serious,
 even quiet, 
whatever your style - you are welcome at “your” Team; Calm Chaos. 
<br><br>
<big><b><u>Calm Chaos has something for you.</u></b></big> The 
camaraderie and sense of belonging are yours for the taking. 
<br><br>
 For those who join our eclectic Team; we can add the “Calm Chaos” text
 
to ANY of the available Avatars; or even to the Individual’s own 
Avatar. We do not however require that you add the text NOR use one of
 our 
Avatars. If you choose to do neither of these, it is perfectly
 acceptable 
to us as our first order is to allow you to be yourself. If you are on 
the fence about joining Calm Chaos feel free to get to know us first it
 
could be that Calm Chaos is the right team for you. If you wish to get 
to know us anonymously before joining, feel free to look around the 
Calm Chaos forums and you may even ask questions to aid in your
 decision. 
<br><br>
<big><b><u>Our look may be a bit dark, but we are always looking for 
the light of truth.</u></b></big> Go not quietly into the night but
 make 
a great noise in calling forth the light. 
<br><br>
 Our emphasis is not of blatant numbers production for its own benefit 
but the inclusion of and assistance to all equally. It does not matter 
if you run one computer or many; your voice and your effort hold equal 
weight and are just as important to us. 
When you reach your decision to join, you will be welcomed to the Team 
with open arms, and open minds. We are confident that Calm Chaos has 
something for everyone, evidenced by the selfless giving of all our 
members who have made this possible, and all are encouraged to
 participate 
anyway they wish to make Team Calm Chaos the most enlightening and 
enjoyable experience it can be.
 Happy crunching, and ALWAYS remember, we are the Calm amidst the 
Chaos!
