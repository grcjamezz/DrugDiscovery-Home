<strong>Hello fellow Carl Sagan team members and future team members!</strong><br>
If you are like most Carl Sagan team members, at some point, you got hooked on the science of space. Most if not all members of our team attribute this addiction to space science as a result of Carl Sagan and 
the wonderful series "COSMOS". Dr. Sagan's ablility to explain space science in a fashion that was very easy to understand created a huge interest in space from people of all ages and walks of life.<br>
<br>If you have been 'touched' by Carl's words and wisdom,<br>this is the team for you. We are NOT hard core scientists.<br>We are just people who have and will continue to admire<br>
the work of Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan. <br>
Some of our members earn 20,000 credits a day, others<br>just a few.. Its not about the credits, Its about the team,<br>
the memory of Carl Sagan, his wisdom and insight in to<br>the cosmos!
