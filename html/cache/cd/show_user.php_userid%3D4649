The Centre is created and fully funded by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) to commemorate the Platinum Jubilee of the Institute, in the year 1984. The Centre is conceived of as a functionally distributed supercomputing environment, housing leading-edge computing systems, with sophisticated software packages, and connected by a powerful high-speed fibre-optic network.

SERC is engaged in research programs (Ph.D. and M.Sc) and course program (M.Tech in Computational Science) in areas relating to supercomputer development and its application to critical areas of science and engineering. The active research areas are broadly classified into three major research streams: Computer Systems, Computational Science, and Bioinformatics. The Centre is also involved in several sponsored research projects in collaboration with many government agencies, public and private sector undertakings, and multinationals, training programme under Centre for Continuing Education (CCE), and research projects under Society for Innovation and Development (SID) . Many of these exercises have fed critical inputs to various national initiatives in High Performance Computing and Communication Technology. The Centre is also involved in Industrial Consultancies on software solution, IT planning for banking sectors, and manpower training";s:6:"nusers";s:1:"2";s:7:"country";s:5:"India";s:12:"total_credit";s:10:"739.298257";s:13:"expavg_credit";s:7:"0.07205";s:11:"expavg_time";s:15:"1297627503.0833";s:7:"seti_id";s:1:"0";s:9:"ping_user";s:1:"0";s:9:"ping_time";s:1:"0";s:8:"joinable";s:1:"1";}}}
